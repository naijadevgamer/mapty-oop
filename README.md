# 🗺️ Mapty

Welcome to **Mapty**! 🎉 This project demonstrates how to use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in JavaScript to create a workout tracking application with interactive maps. 🚀

## 📚 Features

- **Workout Tracking**: Users can log running and cycling workouts, including distance, duration, and additional metrics. 🏃‍♂️🚴‍♀️
- **Interactive Map**: Displays workout locations on an interactive map using Leaflet.js. 🌍
- **Custom Workouts**: Allows users to add custom workouts with specific details and see them on the map. 📍
- **Local Storage**: Saves workouts to local storage so that they persist across page reloads. 💾
- **Form Management**: Toggles between running and cycling inputs based on user selection, and handles form submission and validation. 📋
- **Map Navigation**: Users can click on a workout in the list to navigate to its location on the map. 🗺️

## 🎨 Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: For application logic, OOP principles, and managing state. 🖥️
- **Leaflet.js**: For embedding interactive maps and handling map events. 🗺️
- **HTML/CSS**: For building and styling the application interface. 🎨
